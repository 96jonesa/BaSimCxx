# BaSimCxx
C++ implementation of BaSim

Going into this project, I had only used C++ for a few months in university (... learning it), and I haven't looked at this project in years - while no one knows everything about C++, I knew almost nothing about C++ when I wrote this.

# TODO
  - Only a subset of correct solutions are being found - why?
  - Optimize for speed
  - Multithreaded solving
